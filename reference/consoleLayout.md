# consoleLayout

Function that will display pretty log messages on console

## Usage

``` r
consoleLayout(
  level,
  msg,
  namespace = NA_character_,
  .logcall = sys.call(),
  .topcall = sys.call(-1),
  .topenv = parent.frame()
)
```

## Arguments

- level:

  log level, see
  [`log_levels()`](https://daroczig.github.io/logger/reference/log_levels.html)
  for more details

- msg:

  string message

- namespace:

  string referring to the `logger` environment / config to be used to
  override the target of the message record to be used instead of the
  default namespace, which is defined by the R package name from which
  the logger was called, and falls back to a common, global namespace.

- .logcall:

  the logging call being evaluated (useful in formatters and layouts
  when you want to have access to the raw, unevaluated R expression)

- .topcall:

  R expression from which the logging function was called (useful in
  formatters and layouts to extract the calling function's name or
  arguments)

- .topenv:

  original frame of the `.topcall` calling function where the formatter
  function will be evaluated and that is used to look up the `namespace`
  as well via `logger:::top_env_name`
